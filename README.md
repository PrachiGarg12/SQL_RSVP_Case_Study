**Business Problem**

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022. The production company wants to plan its every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. 
You must analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights to help them start their new project.

**Proposed Solution**

  ▪ The solution analyzes the dataset, exploring tables such as 'movies', 'genre', and 'names' to understand their structure and identify any missing values. 
  
  ▪ It calculates the number of movies released each year, their distribution by month, and the number of movies produced by specific countries like the USA or India. 
  
  ▪ It analyzes movie genres, finding the unique genres, their overall movie count, and the average duration of movies within each genre.
  
  ▪ It examines the ratings table, finding the minimum and maximum values for various columns and listing the top 10 movies based on average rating.
  
  ▪ The analysis also ranks actors and directors based on various criteria, such as the number of movies released in India or the average rating of movies in the drama genre. 
  
  Additionally, it calculates the genre-wise running total and moving average of the average movie duration.
